## ES6 JavaScript Snippets for Visual Studio Code 

A Ruby and Rails snippets pack inspired by [Vense's ruby extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vense.rails-snippets) but with a few of my own twists and added snippets !! :smile:


##### Supported languages (file extensions)

- Ruby (.rb)
- EmbeddedRuby (.erb)
- 

##### tips
1. `control/command + space` loads the snippet suggestions if they aren't shown right away.
2. `${1}` is where the snippet starts. `$0` is where the snippet ends.
3. Press `tab` to move onto the next part of a snippet.
